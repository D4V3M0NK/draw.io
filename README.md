# draw.io
This repo will house shapes, templates and other [draw-io]draw.io resources that I've created over time.
Keyboard is a draw.io template of a US Dell KB212-B keyboard layout. With the exception of the text, everything on the keyboard is a shape (including the Windows logo) which allows the end user to change the colors of anything.
